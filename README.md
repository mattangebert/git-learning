##Part 1 The Perfect Commit

In Order to create a readable and understandable Version Control and not just some sort of backup.
Changes in a single commit should belong with each other and make sense together.

what makes a good commit message?
 - A brief and concise subject line that summarizes the changes
   - brief summary of what happened
   - under 50 characters
   - if you find yourself struggling to come up with something brief, this might be an indicator that the commit tackles too many topics!
 - A descriptive message body that explains the most important facts (and as concisely as possible)
   - What changed in your project with this commit?
   - What was the reason for making this change?
   - Is there anything special to watch out for? Anything someone else should know about these changes?
