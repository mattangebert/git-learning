        There was a farmer who sold a pound of butter to a baker. One day the baker decided to weigh the butter to see
        if he was getting the right amount, which he wasn’t. Angry about this, he took the farmer to court.
    </p>
    <p>
        The judge asked the farmer if he was using any measure to weight the butter. The farmer replied, “Honor,
        I am primitive. I don’t have a proper measure, but I do have a scale.”The judge asked,
        “Then how do you weigh the butter?”
    </p>
    <p>
        The farmer replied; “Your Honor, long before the baker started buying butter from me,
        I have been buying a pound loaf of bread from him. Every day when the baker brings the bread,
        I put it on the scale and give him the same weight in butter. If anyone is to be blamed, it is the baker.”
    </p>
    <p>Moral: Always be good and do good, you get what you give.</p>
