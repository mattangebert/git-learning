    <h1>Weather Diary</h1>

    <p>I decided to write a weather diary</p>
    <p>8:00 its a new day the sun just came out</p>
    <p>8:30 it is a bit cold, i see some clouds at the horizon</p>
    <p>9:00 the clouds are here. Still light grey. I hope it doesnt rain i have to go to work</p>
    <p>9:30 I left for work, of course it started raining</p>
    <p>I like chocolate cakes. Best cake ever</p>
